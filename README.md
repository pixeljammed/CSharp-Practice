# Programs I have made for Hills Road Sixth Form College
- This includes ones I felt were notable enough to showcase my knowledge of C#.
- The rest are minor projects, which were used to learn C# basics. These are found in practice projects.
- Minor projects are seperated into VS Mac and Rider as the former was depricated in 2024.
- One I have chosen not to include here is a basic Server-Client chat app for security reasons.
- The battleboats project is extensive, and includes a development document evaluating written by me.
